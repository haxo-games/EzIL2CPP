there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

base your style on the already existing code).

3\. Make an issue describing your feature or bugfix and specify your intent to address said issue. Once you make the pull request you can auto-close the issue by doing `close #<issue\_number\_here>`.

4\. When making a branch give it a meaningful name like `feature/name\_of\_feature` or `fix/name\_of\_fix`.
