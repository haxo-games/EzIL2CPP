# EzIL2CPP

## What is this?

A single-header C++ helper library to facilitate interaction with the IL2CPP API. Like many of our public projects this was made because we needed it to better explain some of our courses.

## Usage

TODO

## Documentation

There isn't really any documentation regarding the IL2CPP API functions so I decided it could be useful to document them as best as we can here.

## Contributing

This project is free and open source and will remain so forever. You are welcome to contribute. Simply make a pull request for whatever it is you would like to add, but

there are a few things you need to keep in mind:

1. C++17 only for now.
2. snake_case for variable names, PascalCase for namespaces and structures and camelCase for methods and function names (there might be more specifics so please just
base your style on the already existing code).
3. Make an issue describing your feature or bugfix and specify your intent to address said issue. Once you make the pull request you can auto-close the issue by doing `close #<issue_number_here>`.
4. When making a branch give it a meaningful name like `feature/name_of_feature` or `fix/name_of_fix`.
